# ðŸ¥¦ Nutritionist AI

## Overview

**Nutritionist AI** is a Python-based prototype application that helps users make food choices based on ingredients they have. It predicts the taste of a dish, analyzes its nutritional content and recommends similar recipes from the Epicurious database.

This project combines **data science**, **machine learning**, and **web scraping** techniques into a command-line tool.
