# ðŸ¥¦ Nutritionist AI

## Overview

**Nutritionist AI** is a Python-based prototype application that helps users make healthier and tastier food choices based on ingredients they have. It predicts the quality of a potential dish, analyzes its nutritional content, and recommends similar recipes from the Epicurious database.

This project combines **data science**, **machine learning**, and **web scraping** techniques into a user-friendly command-line tool.

## Features

### âœ… Rating Prediction
- Forecasts if a dish made with selected ingredients will be **"bad"**, **"so-so"**, or **"great"**.
- Based on a classification model trained on the Epicurious dataset.

### âœ… Nutritional Analysis
- Displays nutritional values (% Daily Value) for each ingredient.
- Extracted using a public API and normalized for comparison.

### âœ… Recipe Recommendation
- Finds top 3 similar recipes from the Epicurious database.
- Shows each recipe's rating and a direct URL for full instructions.
